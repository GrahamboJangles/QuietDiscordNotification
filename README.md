# QuietDiscordNotification
Discord does not have a feature that allows you to turn down the notification sounds. Also, if you use Windows Volume Mixer to turn down the volume just for Discord, it will automatically turn the volume back up after some time, or after you change playback devices (I think). So I made this.
